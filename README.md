**ServalShell** is an nlc2bash program created by learning the Transformer model proposed in **"Attention Is All You Need"** 2017 research paper. I implemented the Transformer model myself by referring to the **paper** and **Umar Jamil's video**.
For model learning, refer to the **"NL2CMD: An Updated Workflow for Natural
Language to Bash Commands Translation"** paper. **Tellina-Tool** was used for pre-processing and post-processing, and **Hugging Face** was used for tokenizer and dataset.

# How to train 
1. **Install packages**   
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Data preprocessing**
```sh
$ python3 preprocess.py
```
3. **Set config.py values and Train**
```sh
$ python3 train.py
```

# How to run 
1. **Install packages**   
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Create kaggle token**  
Download the kaggle token and put it in the ServalShell folder
```json
{"username":"?????","key":"????????????????????????????"}
```
3. **Download pretrained weights**  
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
$ cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
$ chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
$ kaggle datasets download -d sj2129tommy/nlc2bash-21epoch
$ unzip  -qq /content/ServalShell/nlc2bash-21epoch.zip
```
4. **Run servalshell**  
```sh
$ ./servalshell.sh
```
